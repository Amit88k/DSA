6.	Take N(number of rows), print the following pattern( ex: N=4)  
     0  
     1 1  
     2 3 5  
     8 13 21 34  
    
7.	Take N(number of rows), print following pattern (N=4) 
     1           1    
     1 2       2 1  
     1 2 3   3 2 1

10.	GCD of two numbers  

11.	Given a number n, print all primes smaller than or equal to n. It is also given that n is a small number. (Sieve of Eratosthenes)

12.	Given a number n, print all primes smaller than n. For example, if the given number is 10, output 2, 3, 5, 7. (Segmented Sieve)
NOTE: Time complexity (or number of operations) by Segmented Sieve is same as Simple Sieve. It has advantages for large ‘n’ as it has better locality of reference thus allowing better caching by the CPU and requires less memory space.  

13.	Modular exponentiation   
Given three numbers x, y and p, compute (xy) % p.  
Examples :  
Input:  x = 2, y = 3, p = 5  
Output: 3  
Explanation: 2^3 % 5 = 8 % 5 = 3.  

Input:  x = 2, y = 5, p = 13  
Output: 6  
Explanation: 2^5 % 13 = 32 % 13 = 6.
